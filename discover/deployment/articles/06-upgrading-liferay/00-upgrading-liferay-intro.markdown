# Upgrading to @product@ [](id=upgrading-to-liferay-7)

Upgrading to @product@ consists of two main steps: upgrading your installation
and then upgrading the database. @product@ can be upgraded using a
straightforward process. To upgrade to the latest release directly, you must be
coming from Liferay Portal 6.1 or higher.

If you're on a Liferay Portal version lower than 6.1, you should
[upgrade to Liferay Portal 6.2](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/upgrading-liferay)
before approaching an upgrade to the @product-ver@ platform. 

Before you do anything, however, you should follow the
[pre-upgrade process of cleaning and normalizing your data](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/pre-upgrade-speed-up-the-process).
After that, you can
[prepare your system for the upgrade](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/preparing-an-upgrade-to-liferay-7),
and then finally
[run the upgrade process](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/running-the-upgrade-process). 

The tutorials that follow lead you through these steps.
